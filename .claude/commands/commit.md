Granularly commit the changes from the files in the working tree. Create one commit per logical change (e.g. one commit for a functional update, one commit for fixing a bug, etc.) Commit descriptions should be terse and focus on what changed. DO NOT make any code changes. ALWAYS run `bun run format` and `bun run compile` before making a commit. If there is a compile error, STOP and tell me instead of trying to fix it.
